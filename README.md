Below is a summary of that information:

Project 1: Predicting Salary Based on Years of Experience
Objective:

Develop a predictive model to estimate an employee's salary based on their years of experience.
Use Case:

Description: Use historical employee experience and salary data to predict future salaries.
Business Context: Helps HR teams determine fair and competitive salaries for recruitment and budgeting.
Expected Outcome: Accurate salary predictions based on experience, improving HR decision-making.
Tools Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For model development and evaluation.
Insights Gathered:

There is a high correlation between years of experience and salary.
The linear regression model explains a significant portion of the variance in salary based on experience.


Project 2: Predicting Delivery Time Based on Sorting Time
Objective:

Build a predictive model to estimate delivery time based on package sorting time.
Use Case:

Description: Predict delivery times based on sorting times to optimize logistics operations.
Business Context: Enhances operational efficiency in logistics by providing accurate delivery time predictions.
Expected Outcome: Improved delivery time estimates, leading to better customer satisfaction and resource allocation.
Tools Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For model development and evaluation.
Insights Gathered:

Strong correlation between sorting time and delivery time.
The model provides reliable predictions that can improve logistics planning.
