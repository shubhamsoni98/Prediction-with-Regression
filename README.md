# Prediction-with-Regression
Project 1: Predicting Salary Based on Years of Experience
Objective
Develop a predictive model to estimate an employee's salary based on their years of experience.
Use Case

- **Description:** Use historical data of employee experience and salary to predict future salaries.
- **Business Context:** Helps HR teams in determining fair and competitive salaries for recruitment and budgeting.
- **Expected Outcome:** Accurate salary predictions based on the experience, improving HR decision-making.

Solution Architecture

- **Data Collection:** Historical data of employee experience and salary.
- **Data Processing:** Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering.
- **Model Development:** Simple Linear Regression.
- **Model Evaluation:** R-squared score, residual analysis.

Tools Used
Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Insights Gathered

- High correlation between years of experience and salary.
- The linear regression model explains a significant portion of the variance in salary based on experience.

Challenges Faced

- Ensuring data quality and dealing with any outliers.
- Balancing model complexity with interpretability.

Complexity

- **Data Complexity:** The dataset was relatively simple with two columns, but the relationship between them required careful analysis.
- **Algorithmic Complexity:** Simple linear regression with straightforward implementation.

Time Taken
Approximately 20 Seconds.
Project 2: Predicting Delivery Time Based on Sorting Time
Objective
Build a predictive model to estimate delivery time based on sorting time of packages.
Use Case

- **Business Context:** Enhances operational efficiency in logistics by providing accurate delivery time predictions.
- **Expected Outcome:** Improved delivery time estimates, leading to better customer satisfaction and resource allocation.

Solution Architecture

- **Data Collection:** Data on sorting and delivery times.
- **Data Processing:** Cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- **Model Development:** Simple Linear Regression.
- **Model Evaluation:** R-squared score, residual analysis.

Tools Used
Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Insights Gathered

- Strong correlation between sorting time and delivery time.
- The model provides reliable predictions that can improve logistics planning.

Challenges Faced

- Managing the small dataset size and ensuring the model generalizes well.
- Dealing with slight skewness in the data distribution.

Complexity

- **Data Complexity:** The dataset was small but contained important information on the relationship between sorting and delivery times.
- **Algorithmic Complexity:** Linear regression provided a simple yet effective solution.

Time Taken
Approximately 18 Seconds.
